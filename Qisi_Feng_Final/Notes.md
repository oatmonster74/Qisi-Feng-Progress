Yes..This is Qisi's Final Project!

Cleaned some parts after presentation. 
Added Media Query Screen shots in a folder. My reference is the viewport when the Mac Desktop viewport is being shrinked down to the smallest.

Professor Adee, thank you for teaching us.

I started to know a thing or two about web development(though it still looks scary for beginner sometimes.. )

But yes, afer our class and our actions, thoughts are getting more clear--as they only have power in practice.

Wish you a good summer.

Qisi
