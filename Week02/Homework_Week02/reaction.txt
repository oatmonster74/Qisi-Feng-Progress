5 Considerations:

1.Clarify the Problem
(What problem we want to solve when design the web?)

2.Workflows and Sketches
(A process to generate some possible critical question---like what the web will look like when errors happen?
or any redirection)

(which screens are necessary??)


3.Feedback
(Share code and talk about it with people to have different opinions)

4.Know your tools
(choose a comfortable tool; don't waste time on tools, save your energy on problem and its solution)

5.Connect your wireframe to audience
(different wireframes for different audience..)
